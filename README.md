# Steemit-Competition-Script
This script is intended for people who host competitions on Steemit. Often the entrants are required to upvote the post, resteem/reblog and follow the competition host. This script allows you to enter your username and the link to your post on which you're hosting the competition, it checks who voted, reblogged and followed you and picks a random winner from all entrants who fit the above criteria. 


## Prerequisites
You need to have at least **Python version 3.5** or newer as well as **pip**. 

## Installation
In order to use this script you need to have the steem-python library installed. You can get it by running the following command: 
````$ pip install steem````
